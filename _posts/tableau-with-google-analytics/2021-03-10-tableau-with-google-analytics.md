Worked on Client's request to transform existing reporting into automated BI solutions. Here are the before and after screenshots from the projects.
To ensure Client's confidentiality, some parts of dashboards are removed or censored.

First, I connected Tableau with Google Analytics API :

The first dashboard was around common GA KPIs :

**After**

The second dashboard was on year-on-year change in KPIs:
**Before**

</figure>

**After**

Last dashboard was specific to revenue distribution & other financial KPIs:
**Before**

**After**

Project was successfully delivered as per Client's demand and below is **Client's testimony** :
